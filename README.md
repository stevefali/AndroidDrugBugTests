# AndroidDrugbugTests

This project is for testing out my ideas in preparation for making an Android app for [DrugBug](https://github.com/stevefali/DrugBug).
I mainly want to refresh my memory of how to do certain things on Android, and also try out some ideas I have for improving my app architecture and code quality, as well as integrating auth using JWT for Android.
